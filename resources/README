Overview
This program executes trim_galore FLASH, 
translation of fastq into fasta files, makes 
the files appear demultiplexed by QIIME before 
concatenating for QIIME. 

Warning: This program performs the processes described above on all R1.fastq and R2.fastq files
in a folder. It is possible that the output from these files will be very large
This program does not delete intermediate files. If file size is an issue please clean some space
in your hard drive and delete intermediate files after running.

**To use this program it is necessary to have cutadapt and FLASH installed and 
**in the $PATH
**Refer to each programs' installation guide for information on how to install
**To add a file to the PATH edit ~/.bashrc and add the line 
**export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/directory/containing_program
**to the end of the file

USER INPUT
User input is required in two places. The first time user input is required, it will be to select the folder containing the
 R1 and R2 fastq reads. Select that folder and press open to confirm. Reads must be available in such a way that their filenames are
 
 unique_nameR1.fastq and unique_nameR2.fastq to allow the program to match the reads and run them through the rest of the process.
 
 Finally after trimming and FLASHing it will become necessary to make sure that the names you give reads are usable
