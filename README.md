# QiimePipeline
A pipeline for applying qiime in the Edgcomb lab. 
Features some basic classes in R1 and R2 (that represent different filetypes given by the sequencing facility) as well as a pretty generic pipeline. This could have mostly been made as a shell script, but due to the complexity of the inputs/outputs, it was easier for me to use a typed language.
